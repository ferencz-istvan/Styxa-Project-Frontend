    <p class="m-5">
      Hello, I'm Ferencz István, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you. Originally, I
      embarked on a career as a teacher, dedicating several years to education. While teaching was
      fulfilling in many ways, I eventually realized it wasn't my true calling. Eager for a change,
      I turned my attention to the ever-evolving world of web development.
    </p>
    <p class="m-5">
      My journey into IT began when I discovered a promising opportunity through an online
      advertisement for styxa.ro. This platform offered an "Intro-IT" course in Hungarian, designed
      to introduce newcomers to the fundamentals of information technology. Over the course of three
      intensive months, I delved into a variety of subjects essential for a career in web
      development.
    </p>
    <p class="m-5">During the program, I gained hands-on experience with:</p>
    <ul class="ml-14 leading-loose list-disc">
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">Algorithms and Data Structures: </span> Understanding the
        building blocks of efficient coding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">Relational Database Management: </span> Learning how to handle
        and organize data effectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">JavaScript: </span> Mastering this versatile language for both
        client-side and server-side development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">Node.js and Express.js: </span> Building the backend of web
        applications with these powerful tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-semibold">Vue.js: </span> Creating dynamic and responsive frontends using
        this modern JavaScript framework.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="m-5">
      The culmination of this course was a comprehensive project, which you are now viewing as this
      very website. Here, I applied the knowledge and skills I acquired to develop a functional and
      aesthetically pleasing web platform.
    </p>
    <p class="m-5">
      The course was a transformative experience for me, igniting a passion for web development that
      I hadn't anticipated. It provided not only technical skills but also a new perspective on
      problem-solving and creativity in the digital realm. This website represents the beginning of
      my journey in IT, and I am excited to continue exploring and growing within this dynamic
      field.
    </p>
    <p class="m-5">
      As I look ahead, I am enthusiastic about the endless possibilities that web development
      offers. Whether it’s creating innovative solutions, improving user experiences, or continuing
      to learn and adapt to new technologies, I am committed to making a meaningful impact in the IT
      world.
